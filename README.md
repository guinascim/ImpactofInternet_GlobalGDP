# Impact of Internet on Global GDP Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the code and data for a data analysis project focused on examining the impact of internet usage on the global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) over the period of 2010 to 2030. The analysis aims to explore the relationship between internet penetration rates and economic growth across different countries.

## Data Sources
- **Global GDP Data (2010-2020):** The dataset provides annual GDP values for various countries from 2010 to 2020. 
- **Internet Users Data (2010-2020):** This dataset includes information on the number of internet users worldwide from 2010 to 2020.
- **Predicted GDP Data (2021-2030):** The predictions for the next ten years (2021-2030) have been generated using linear regression models based on historical GDP and internet users data.

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: This directory contains the raw data files used in the analysis.
- `code/`: Here, you can find the Python scripts used for data preprocessing, analysis, and prediction.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks are provided to walk through the analysis steps and visualize the results.
- `results/`: This folder contains the output files generated during the analysis, such as plots, tables, and predictions.
- `README.md`: You are currently reading the README file, which provides an overview of the project.

## Analysis Steps
1. **Data Preparation:** The raw data is loaded, cleaned, and preprocessed to ensure consistency and accuracy.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Various visualizations are created to understand the trends and relationships between GDP and internet usage over time.
3. **Modeling:** Linear regression models are trained using historical GDP and internet users data to predict future GDP values.
4. **Prediction:** Predictions for the next ten years (2021-2030) are generated using the trained models.
5. **Evaluation:** The accuracy of the predictions is assessed, and the potential impact of internet usage on future GDP growth is discussed.

## Results
- The analysis reveals a strong correlation between internet penetration rates and GDP growth across countries.
- Predictions suggest a significant increase in global GDP over the next decade, driven by continued expansion of internet access and usage.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `code/` directory and run the Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks to reproduce the analysis.
3. Explore the data, visualizations, and predictions generated during the analysis.
4. Feel free to modify and extend the analysis as needed for your own research or projects.
